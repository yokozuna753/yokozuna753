### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

POV: The year is 2021 and crypto prices/mining are off the charts. You suddenly hear about mining crypto to make $$ with only a GPU... Crazy right?! Well, that's exactly how I ended up learning to build a mining rig, let alone a PC, in a few weeks. After trying out some courses in FreeCodeCamp, I came across Full Stack Development and it was love at first (or maybe second) sight. I now spend my days building web applications, rock climbing, watching Anime, Gaming, and much more!
